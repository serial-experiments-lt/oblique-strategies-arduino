# Oblique Strategies for Arduino

by [@pelinski](https://github.com/pelinski) and [@lewiswolf](https://github.com/lewiswolf).

You will need an Arduino Uno with an LCD screen (instructions on how to connect them are [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/lcd-displays)). Only up to 20 oblique strategies fit into the Arduino's dynamic memory. You can refresh the oblique strategies by running

```
python generate_strategies_set.py
```

then recompile and upload to the board.
